•	Introduction of the Panchayati Raj aimed at securing effective participation of the people. But this hardly happens since the key administrative and technical positions are manned by the government officials. Generally, there is lack of proper cooperation and coordination between the people and the officials like Block Development Officers, the District Officers etc.
•	So, there is a secured and transparent system needed which enable an ordinary person to directly apply for a scheme and track the status from time to time and know whether he is entitled to receive the fruit, or his application is rejected by the officials. In any case, the applicant should be able to know the reason for rejection openly. This catches trust in the Government from the people and avoids mis-utilization of funds.
